# E-commerce
This is my first PHP project. It's a simple E-commerce website created using XAMP and netbeans. This website handles the operation of both i.e. User and admin. Admin powers includes the updation of items in the website and databases. On the other hand user can purchase the items and can also keep a track on his/her past transactions and repeat the items.
The project is integrated with database using SQL and php framework Laravel.
The prject is mobile and tablet responsive as well inorder to ensure best UI experience to users.
